## About

I am an undergraduate at Tufts University majoring in Data Science. I have been passionate about data analysis and machine learning since my junior year in high school and I have been constantly advancing my data science skills. This is a documentation of my learning experience, including a wide range of projects that I did on my own as well as learned from experts.
